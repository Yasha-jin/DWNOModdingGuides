## Step 3

This step is pretty simple, just run the game once. Yep, that's all. Game will take a bit more time to launch so BepInEx get setup properly. After the game has launched, you can just close it.

If everything went fine, the BepInEx folder contents will change from this :

## Step 4 (Finale)

Now that BepInEx is properly installed, you can finally add some mods !

You can find mods for DWNO on those sites :

- [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/digimonworldnextorder)

Be mindful that some mods can have different installation process (BepInEx DLLs, changing a .cpk file, using CriBindDir, etc), the mod uploader generally indicate how to install them. But we'll focus on the BepInEx DLLs here.

Pick whatever mods you want, but for this guide i'll pick this one : [Camera Distance](https://www.nexusmods.com/digimonworldnextorder/mods/2)

After downloading the mod, put the .dll in BepInEx/plugins, it should then looks like this :

Now, simply run the game.

Go into an open area, and press the zoom button, you should be able to zoom way past the limit.
